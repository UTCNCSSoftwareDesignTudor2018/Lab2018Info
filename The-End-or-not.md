Hi everyone. I updated the grading gdrive doc with the grading.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ApGptGUDw5_2XexFEp67ymz8_GobG8YynoDnl13CxBc/edit?usp=sharing

Below you will find some observations that I would like to keep in mind, regrardless if it applies to you at this moment

Project Final Doc + Code grading

The vast majority of projects (implementation) are good. I appreciate the effort and hope that it was a good level-up experience.

I especially appreciate the work of the students who used several technologies - keep up the good work, but PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT DISREGARD the process of analysing & documenting the project. If you do, you most likely will realize in 2-3 years that although you were on an accelerated career trajectory, you now hit "the ceiling" because there is so much you can do just by "hacking it" 

The main issues regarding the projects:
	- not putting enought thougth into the documentation
	- too simple projects
	- unfinished project 
	- few commits - which begs the question who actually did the project

Criteria used for grading (as per the greenboard in May): 
	- Doc final quality / completeness	
	- Layers + another arch style	
	- 2-5 Design Patterns	
	- 2-3 OTM/MTM/MTO relations	
	- frameworks / libraries	
	- MVN / gradle / nuGet	
	- Unit Tests	
	- Input validation 	
	- > 6 code commits

Exam (Lab + Project part) grading

Congratulations, everybody passed, although there were a few 'surprises'. But some good also :)

Out of the students from group 30432 present at the exam:
- 16% got 10
- 36% received 9
- 32% received 8

The grading was normalized, more exactly everyone received a 3% bump to the actual grade (many 'x.35- x.45 grades). This bump factor favors the students who got bigger marks intentionally (as we discussed from the beginning, helping the people who work more)

Important aspects to point-out (hoping you will address them even though you completed the course) for your career:
	- many students do not know how to argue about a specific point, some resorting to 'tricks' of ennumerating unnecessary patterns etc
	- several people do not know or know partially how to model a high level architecture, even-though the boundaries were clearly requested
	- many students do not know how to model the Order-Products relation in E-R and/or Code (yes, ShoppingCart is almost the same as Order)
	- many students separated the product from the corresponding quantity

As a final thought, 3 things:
	
	1) please take the internship seriously and learn as much as you can. It does not matter if the company/mentors don't 'invest' in you, BUT PLEASE be proactive, ask (even if it seems stupid - just be sure you checked enough google/stackoverflow pages before) and put your mind to it
	
	2) If Friday June 22nd works for you, let meet for beer somewhere in Pta Muzeului. I'm not buying ;)
	
	3) I strongly encourage the colleagus that feel they could have done more to go for re-evaluation in autumn (mariri). You can contact me in case there is a need to re-evaluate the lab/project work (you re-do it first)
