	* please add links to 2-3 web resources you found better explanatory than GOF 
	* please state which of the 5 SOLID principles this pattern "helps/supports/..." and why?

	
3) Related patterns 
	* please state the related pattern and the main 2-3 differentiators 
	* ex: builder for factory method

	
4) Common situations of use
	* please identify 2-4 situations where this pattern is commonly used (basically situations like "Composite is found in Paint-like programs", in frameworks or libraries or in user flows (like undo in Excel))

	
5) Can be mistaken with the XYZ design pattern
	* please identify with what pattern it can be mistakenly identifies (either it's similar in structure, of the naming is misleading)
	*ex: "facade and decorator might be considered similar/mistaken, due to the naming meaning in real-life. They are (similar and) different because X, Y, Z
